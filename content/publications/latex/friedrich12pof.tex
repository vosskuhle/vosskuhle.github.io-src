A statistical analysis of the two-point vorticity statistics in the inverse energy cascade of two-dimensional turbulence is presented in terms of probability density functions (PDFs).
Evolution equations for the PDFs are derived in the framework of the Lundgren--Monin--Novikov hierarchy, and the unclosed terms are studied with the help of direct numerical simulations (DNS).
Furthermore, the unclosed terms are evaluated in a Gaussian approximation and compared to the DNS results.
It turns out that the statistical equations can be interpreted in terms of the dynamics of screened vortices.
The two-point statistics is related to the dynamics of two point vortices with screened velocity field, where an effective relative motion of the two point vortices originating from the turbulent surroundings is identified to be a major characteristics of the dynamics underlying the inverse cascade.
