The multiple-point probability density $f(v_1, r_1; v_2, r_2; \dots v_N, r_N)$ of velocity increments $v_i$ at different length scales $r_i$ is investigated in a direct numerical simulation of two-dimensional turbulence.
It has been shown for experimental data of three-dimensional turbulence, that this probability density can be represented by conditional probability densities in form of a Markov chain [Friedrich~R \& Peinke~J, Phys.~Rev.~Lett.~\textbf{78}, 863 (1997)].
We have extended this analysis to the case of two-dimensional forced turbulence in the inverse cascade regime.
