Turbulence facilitates collisions between particles suspended in a turbulent flow.
Two effects have been proposed which can enhance the collision rate at high turbulence intensities: \lq preferential concentration\rq (a clustering phenomenon) and the 'sling effect' (arising from the formation of caustic folds in the phase-space of the suspended particles).
We have determined numerically the collision rate of small heavy particles as a function of their size and densities.
The dependence on particle densities reveals that the enhancement by turbulence of the collision rate of particles with significant inertia is due almost entirely to the sling effect.
