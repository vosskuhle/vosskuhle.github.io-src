We present an overview of recent works on the statistical description of turbulent flows in terms of probability density functions (PDFs) in the framework of the Lundgren–Monin–Novikov (LMN) hierarchy.
Within this framework, evolution equations for the PDFs are derived from the basic equations of fluid motion.
The closure problem arises either in terms of a coupling to multi-point PDFs or in terms of conditional averages entering the evolution equations as unknown functions.
We mainly focus on the latter case and use data from direct numerical simulations (DNS) to specify the unclosed terms.
Apart from giving an introduction into the basic analytical techniques, applications to two-dimensional vorticity statistics, to the single-point velocity and vorticity statistics of three-dimensional turbulence, to the temperature statistics of Rayleigh–Bénard convection and to Burgers turbulence are discussed.
